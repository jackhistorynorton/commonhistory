# Introduction to Markdown Tutorial ##

When you write for this class, you'll write in plain text documents. You can save your documents as plain text in any program that lets you write (MS Word, Notepad, Pages, text editors). When you "Save As" select txt. 

When formatting your writing, I'm going to have your use a writing syntax called Markdown. It's easier to learn than abbreviations for texting and allows you to write in words with everyday punctuation marks that can be saved and published in lots of different places. By writing in markdown, you can create a website, create a pdf, or create a word document with ease. 

Please complete this [Markdown Tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). Then, when you write papers for me, you can use Markdown to format your papers. Saving a document as markdown (.md or .mdown) is just a text file, even with the different file ending.
